# Personal Portfolio Website

A static personal website built with **HTML** and **CSS**, designed to showcase my skills, experiences, and interests.  
The site is fully responsive and visually structured to provide a clean, user-friendly experience without any JavaScript.

> ⚠️ This project was created as part of my internship at Accenture for educational purposes and personal development.
