# Personal Portfolio Website

A **personal portfolio website** built with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, designed to showcase my projects, skills, experience, and certificates. The design is clean, minimal, and **fully responsive** across all devices — with enhanced interactivity powered by JavaScript.

> ⚠️ This project was created as part of my internship at Accenture for educational purposes and personal development.
